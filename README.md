# Association-rule-mining

Association rule mining is used for generating rules resembling if-else conditions which are made of frequent item sets. The main aim was to find patterns or correlations in the features of the cricket dataset and identify patterns that are most important. Basically the association rule is made of 2 parts: antecedent and consequent. The antecedent is like the IF part which occurs on the left side of the rule and the consequent is the THEN part which occurs on the right side of the rule. This can simply be represented as X => Y where X is the set of input features and Y is the output or set of output features:

      X (Factor, Cause, Input, Predictor) => Y (Effect, Output, Response) 

In this paticular example in which I have applied association rule mining,

The final set of features were generated after extensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
